        <h1>Reys Aden</h1>
        <p>I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at Drake University, concentrating in Software Engineering.
           I have experience in software development, machine learning, and data-driven problem solving through internships, research, and personal projects. My work includes building applications that improve workflows, training computer vision models for real-world challenges, and applying mathematical modeling to practical problems.
           I enjoy learning new technologies, applying them to impactful projects, and contributing to teams that value innovation and collaboration.</p>
